\begin{homeworkProblem}
    I chose PEPSICO INC. which is famous multinational food, snack, and
    beverage corporation. Most of data used in evaluating share price is come
    from CapitalIQ, and if data which is necessary to evaluate stock price
    is unobserved, it is estimated by myself.
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item   %% question a)
        I collected analyst's forecast of sales revenue of PepsiCo over next
        seven years. Table \ref{tab:part1-expectedcf} shows the estimated
        revenue. Estimated revenue grows moderately.
        \item   %% question b)
        Analyst's forecast data of company's EBITDA from FY2018 to FY2022
        is collected from CapitalIQ, and since the average EBITDA growth is
        about 6\% per year, I assumed that EBITDA will grow at 6\% over the
        last 2 years. Table \ref{tab:part1-expectedcf} shows the estimated
        EBITDA. Using this data, EBITDA/Sales margin was calculated.
        Table \ref{tab:part1-margins} shows estimated EBITDA/Sales margin.
        \item   %% question c)
        In order to estimate free cash flow, estimation for EBIT is needed first.
        As mentioned above, EBITDA was estimated by using analyst's forecast
        and by estimation of growth. Depreciation and amortization is estimated
        by estimating depreciation margin which is (Depreciation / Sales Revenue).
        Depreciation margin is estimated by averaging past 3 years' margin, and
        is assumed constant over 7 years. The margin was calculatd as 3.44\%.
        Tax rate used for calculating tax affected EBIT is 21\%.
        Changes in net working capital is estimated by estimating days in
        receivables, inventory, payables and others. They were estimated by
        averaging past 3 years' data and were assumed to be constant over 7 years.
        Table \ref{tab:part1-estimated days} shows estimated days of each account.
        Capital expenditure is estimated by estimating CapEx margin, which was
        calculated by averaging past 3 year's data. From the procedure, free
        cash flow was calculated as Table \ref{tab:part1-expectedcf}.
        \input{cashflow.tex}
        \input{margin.tex}
        \input{days.tex}
        \item   %% question d)
        Since the food, snack and beverage industry is matured enough,
        it does not seem that the company will grow fast. Therefore,it is
        reasonable to assume that long run growth rate of free cash flow will be
        stable. Therefore, I chose the appropriate long run growth rate as 2\%.
        \item   %% question e)
        In order to calculate WACC of PepsiCo, cost of equity and cost of debt
        was calculated first. Using CapitalIQ's data, equity beta of the company
        is estimated as about 0.7. Since the given risk-free rate and market risk
        premium is 2\% and 5\%, respectively, using CAPM, cost of equity of
        the firm is calculated as $2\% + 0.7 \times 5\% = 5.53\%$. (Equity beta
        is slightly larger than 0.7 in actual.) Since the credit rating of the
        firm is A+, debt beta is estimated as 0.05. Then by using CAPM, cost
        of debt is calculated as 2.25\%. Applying tax benefit to cost of debt,
        after tax cost of debt is calculated as 1.78\%. From the balance sheet
        of the firm, proportion of equity financing is about 80.27\%, and
        proportion of debt financing is about 19.73\%. Using this data, WACC
        of the firm is calculated as 4.79\%.
        \item   %% question f)
        \item   %% question g)
        \item   %% question h)
