\begin{homeworkProblem}

\end{homeworkProblem}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	Question 2
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{homeworkProblem}
    The current capital structure and payout policies of the firm
    are not appropriate since there are lots of benefits from using debt.
    Of course, increasing leverage makes firm's revenue risky,
    but on the current status, compensation from increasing leverage is much larger
    since the current amount of debt is zero.
    Most of firms which uses debt has larger market-to-book ratio,
    and larger ROE than Blaine Kitchenware. Assuming that industrial background
    among the firms are negligible, it justifies the argument that Blaine should
    raise debt. It is reasonable to increase D/V ratio to 17.09\%, which is
    the average D/V ratio of other firms.
\end{homeworkProblem}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	Question 3
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{homeworkProblem}
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item   %% question a)
        \begin{enumerate}[1)]
            \item   %% 1)
            From exhibit 3 of the case, we can find cash, enterprise value,
            debt, and equity of the firm at 2006.
            Table \ref{tab:bs_before_announcement} shows the balance sheet
            before announcement.
            \input{current_balance.tex}
            \item   %% 2)
            After the announcement but before any debt issuance or repurchase
            is made, under perfect market, the balance sheet does not change
            because the announcement itself does not affect capital structure
            and systematic risk of the firm. Therefore, the balance sheet
            after announcement is same as Table \ref{tab:bs_before_announcement}.
            \item   %% 3)
            After the firm issue 100,000(thousand dollars) amount of debt,
            debt increases and cash also increases on balance sheet.
            Therefore, the balance sheet of the firm changes to
            Table \ref{tab:bs_after_debt_perfect}. Equity value and enterprise
            value does not change.
            \input{after_debt_perfect.tex}
            \item   %% 4)
            After repurchase, 300,000 amount of cash decreases, and the same
            value of equity also decreases. Although market value of equity
            decreased, because the same amount of cash also decreased,
            therefore, enterprise value does not change. Furthermore, since
            number of shares also decreased, stock price also does not change.
            \input{after_repurchase_perfect.tex}
            Stock price before repurchase is \$16.25 per share, so the number
            of share repurchased is equal to $300,000 / 16.25 = 18,461$, and
            the number outstanding share is decreased to $59,052 - 18,461 = 40,591$.
            Hence, the new share price is equal to $659,596 / 40,591 = 16.25$,
            which is same as the price before repurchase.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item   %% question b)
        \begin{enumerate}[1)]
            \item   %% 1)
            Before the announcement, the balance sheet is same as
            Table \ref{tab:bs_before_announcement}.
            \item   %% 2)
            Unlike answers in question a)-2), the balance sheet does change
            because there is tax benefit if debt is issued and cash is decreased,
            and equity value reflects the benefit. Increase in equity value
            would be same as present value of tax benefit from issuing debt
            and decrease in cash.
            Present value of tax shield from debt is calculated by multiplying
            interest expense to corporate tax rate, and discounting at cost of debt.
            Assuming Blaine's credit rating is Baa, corporate bond yield is
            equal to 6.72\%. Therefore, interest expense at each fiscal year is
            calculated as $100,000 \times 6.72\% \times 30.76\% = 2,067.072$.
            Therefore, present value of income tax shield from issuing debt
            is equal to $\frac{2,067.072}{0.06} = 34,451.2$.
            Assuming amount of cash on balance sheet grows at risk-free rate,
            if the firm does not repurchase stock, it should pay
            $200,000 \times 5.10\% \times 30.76\% = 3,137.52$ for tax every year.
            (We used 30-year US treasury rate as risk-free rate.) Therefore,
            by using perpetuity formula, the present value of tax benefit from
            cash deducting is equal to $\frac{3,137.52}{0.06} = 52,292$.
            Hence, after the announcement of stock repurchase, equity value
            would increase by $34,451.2 + 52,292 = 86,743.2$. Since other
            accounts are constant, enterprise value would also increase by
            86,743.2 thousand dollars. Table \ref{tab:bs_after_announcement_imperfect}
            represents balance sheet after the announcement under market in which
            corporate tax exists.
            \input{after_announcement_tax.tex}
            Since the number of outstanding share in 2006 is 59,052 and it
            remains constant after the announcement, stock price per share
            would increase to $1,046,339.2 / 59,052 = \$17.72$.
            \item   %% 3)
            Like question a)-3), issuance of debt increases both debt and cash
            by 100,000. Table \ref{tab:bs_after_debt_imperfect} represents
            the balance sheet after issuance of debt. It does not affect enterprise
            value.
            \input{after_debt_tax.tex}
            \item   %% 4)
            The repurchase of stock makes cash and equity decrease by 300,000.
            Table \ref{tab:bs_after_repurchase_imperfect} represents the result
            after repurchase of shares. The repurchase does not make stock price
            change because the information of repurchase was already reflected
            before the actual repurchase.
            \input{after_repurchase_tax.tex}
            The amount of share repurchased is equal to $300,000 / 17.72 = 16,930$.
            Therefore, the number of outstanding share decreases to 42,118.
            Since the new equity value is equal to 746,339, the new share price
            is equal to $746,339 / 42,118 = 17.72$, which is same as the price
            before repurchase.
